Create a movie-browsing web application that allows users to search for movies with advanced filtering options and save their favorite movies. The application should be responsive and accessible.

## Requirements:

- [ ] Use a modern frontend framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) to build the application to create a responsive, mobile-first UI.

- [ ] Use a public movie API (e.g., IMDb API, TMDB API) to fetch movie data.

- [ ] Display a list of movies on the homepage, including the movie title, poster image, and release year.

- [ ] Implement a search feature that allows users to search for movies by title. The search should fetch and update the list of movies dynamically as the user types.

- [ ] Implement infinite scrolling to handle large numbers of search results. Extra points if you donâ€™t use a third-party solution.

- [ ] Implement advanced filtering options for movies, such as filtering by genre, release year range, and rating range. Filters should update the list of movies dynamically. [optional]

- [ ] Allow users to save their favorite movies. Favorite movies should be stored locally (e.g., using browser storage). [optional]

- [ ] Ensure the application is SEO-friendly and accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility best practices.

- [ ] Write clean, well-structured code following best practices

- [ ] Provide documentation explaining how to run the application, your design decisions, and any additional features implemented. Also, mention any possible improvements in your implementation.
